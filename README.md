## Developer Setup & Local Compilation

If you want to modify or compile this mod locally from source:

### 0. Get the Source
Already working in a clone of [`whozghiar/jak-project`](https://github.com/whozghiar/jak-project)? Switch to this mod there, keeping your extracted game data:
```bash
task modding-switch -- jak3-mod-peaceful-haven-city
```
Otherwise clone it on its own; the knowledge base used by AI agents is a submodule, so clone with it:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/whozghiar/jak3-mod-peaceful-haven-city.git
```
To pull the latest modding base into this mod later, run `task modding-sync-branch`.

### 1. Select the Active Game
Make sure your environment is targeting Jak 3:
```bash
task set-game-jak3
```

### 2. Binary Compilation
- **Status:** [Not required (GOAL-only mod, standard binaries sufficient) / `task build-release-game` (engine or compiler C++ changed) / `task build-release` + `task extract` (decompiler or decompiler/config changed)]
- **Details:** [Specify which C++ layer was modified — see `docs/modding/guides/task_scripts_reference.md`, section 3]
```bash
# GOAL-only mod: nothing to build — go straight to the REPL below.
# Engine / compiler C++ changed:
task build-release-game
# Decompiler or decompiler/config changed (then step 3 is mandatory):
task build-release-decomp
```

### 3. Asset Extraction
- **Status:** [Required (`task extract`) / Standard extraction sufficient]
- **Details:** [Specify if custom 3D models, textures, or sound banks require extraction]
```bash
task extract
```

### 4. Launch the Game
Run the game natively:
```bash
task boot-game
```
*(Or launch via the OpenGOAL REPL using `task repl`, then compile and run with `(mi)` and `(r)`).*
